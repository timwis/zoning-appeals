Leaflet is a modern open-source JavaScript library for mobile-friendly interactive maps.
It is developed by [Vladimir Agafonkin][] with a&nbsp;team of dedicated [contributors][].
Weighing just about <abbr title="33 KB gzipped &mdash; that's 123 KB minified and 218 KB in the source form, with 10 KB of CSS (2 KB gzipped) and 11 KB of images.">33 KB of JS</abbr>,
it has all the [features][] most developers ever need for online maps.

Leaflet is designed with _simplicity_, _performance_ and _usability_ in mind.
It works efficiently across all major desktop and mobile platforms out of the box,
taking advantage of HTML5 and CSS3 on modern browsers while still being accessible on older ones.
It can be extended with a huge amount of [plugins][],
has a beautiful, easy to use and [well-documented API][]
and a simple, readable [source code][] that is a&nbsp;joy to [contribute][] to.

<div id="map" class="map" style="height: 300px"></div>

In this basic example, we create a map with <abbr title="Here we use OpenStreetMap tiles, but Leaflet doesn't force you to &mdash; use whatever works for you, it's open source!">tiles of our choice</abbr>, add a marker and bind a popup with some text to it:

	// create a map in the "map" div, set the view to a given place and zoom
	var map = L.map('map').setView([51.505, -0.09], 13);

	// add an OpenStreetMap tile layer
	L.tileLayer('http://{s}.tile.osm.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png', {
		attribution: '&copy; <a href="http://osm.org/copyright">OpenStreetMap</a> contributors'
	}).addTo(map);

	// add a marker in the given location, attach some popup content to it and open the popup
	L.marker([51.5, -0.09]).addTo(map)
		.bindPopup('A pretty CSS3 popup. <br> Easily customizable.')
		.openPopup();
